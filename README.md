# Indian agriculture portal
A simple portal designed in c++ for farmers which is a one stop solution for them such as:\

1. They can register themselves here and will get a unique identification number.
2. They can enquire about minimum support price (MSP) decided by government.
3. They can apply for loans and may get benefits from other govt. schemes.
